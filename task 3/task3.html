                <p class="p1">Kanyakumari is a coastal town in the state of Tamil Nadu on India's southern tip. 
                    Jutting into the Laccadive Sea, the town was known as Cape Comorin during British rule and is popular for watching sunrise and sunset over the ocean. 
                    It's also a noted pilgrimage site thanks to its Bagavathi Amman Temple, dedicated to a consort of Shiva, and its Our Lady of Ransom Church, a center of Indian Catholicism.
                    Kanyakumari is popular because it is the only places on earth, where you can see the Sun Rise and Sun Set from the ocean. It is the only place in India where one can enjoy the unique spectacle of Sunset and Moonrise simultaneously on full moon days.
                    Kanyakumari is the land of Goddess Parvati and bears witness to the confluence of the Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. Also known as Cape Comorin, Kanyakumari is held in high regards by the Hindus owing to its scared temples. One of the main attractions in Kanyakumari is the Kumari Amman Temple.
                    Bhagavathy Amman Temple is a 3000-year-old temple dedicated to Goddess Kumari Amman located at Kanniyakumari.

                <p class="p2">The town of Kanyakumari is named after the Hindu Goddess Kanya Kumari, an incarnation of the divine Mother Goddess. A popular pilgrimage destination, devotees travel to Kanyakumari to make an offering at the Bhagavati Kumari Amman temple, which is dedicated to the virgin Goddess. Kanyakumari is also famous for being the southernmost point in India.
                    With a dainty nickname of 'Cape Comorin', Kanyakumari lies at the southernmost tip of mainland India. This beautiful town of Tamil Nadu is located at the intersection of the Arabian Sea, the Indian Ocean, and the Gulf of Mannar and thus given a tagline of 'the land of three seas'.
